            <h2>The Beginning (1950s-1960s)</h2>
            <p>Research Triangle Park was born from a bold vision in the 1950s. North Carolina leaders recognized that the state needed to move beyond its traditional industries of textiles, furniture, and tobacco. They saw an opportunity to create something special by connecting three major research universities with industry.</p>
            
            <p>In 1959, the Research Triangle Foundation was established, and the first land was purchased. The idea was revolutionary: create a research park that would attract companies by offering access to the talent and resources of Duke University, UNC-Chapel Hill, and NC State University.</p>
