## Troubleshooting

### Website not showing up?
- **Wait 2-3 minutes** - GitHub needs time to build
- **Check the URL** - Make sure you're using the correct one from Settings → Pages
- **Check repository is Public** - GitHub Pages only works with public repos (free tier)

### Images not loading?
- Make sure all image files are uploaded
- Check file paths in HTML are correct
- Use relative paths like `images/photo.jpg` not absolute paths

### Map not working?
- Google Maps embed should work automatically
- If issues, check that iframe code is correct in HTML files

### Changes not appearing?
- **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Wait 2-3 minutes after pushing changes
- Check that files were actually committed

## Your Website URL Format

Once published, your website will be available at:
```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/rtp-community-website/
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

---

## Example URLs

If your GitHub username is `johndoe`, your website will be:
```
https://johndoe.github.io/rtp-community-website/
```
